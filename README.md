# Setup and installation instructions
  ## Requirements
- Ruby 2.7.4
- Bundle 
- Rails
- NodeJS (v16), and npm

### Setting up the frontend
- When you're ready to start building your project, run:

```
npm install --prefix client
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled --prefix client
npm start --prefix client
```
- `rails s`: run the backend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm start --prefix client`: run the frontend on
  [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

- Open the project using your preferred code editor, preferably Visual studio to inspect the code.

### Setting up the backend
- Start by cloning the repository to your computer from https://github.com/JosephNjeruNjenga/movie-forum
- Verify which version of Ruby you're running by entering this in the terminal:

```console
$ ruby -v
```

We recommend version 2.7.4. If you need to upgrade you can install it using rvm:

```console
$ rvm install 2.7.4 --default
```

You should also install the latest versions of `bundler` and `rails`:

```console
$ gem install bundler
$ gem install rails
```

### Install NodeJS

Verify you are running a recent version of Node with:

```sh
node -v
```

If your Node version is not 16.x.x, install it and set it as the current and
default version with:

```sh
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
nvm alias default 16
```

You can also update your npm version with:

```sh
npm i -g npm
```
- When you're ready to start running the backend server, run:
 ```
 rails server
 ```
